# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project involves building a movie recommendation system using machine learning and data science techniques. The system suggests movies to users based on their interests and preferences using both **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** approaches.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Objective

- **Goal**: Recommend movies to users by analyzing movie metadata and user preferences.
- **Approach**:
  - Content-Based Filtering: Recommends similar movies based on features like genres, keywords, cast, and director.
  - Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user behavior and ratings (if available).

## ðŸ§  Key Features of the Project

- Cleaned and preprocessed movie metadata including titles, genres, tags, and descriptions.
- Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to find similar movies.
- Built a **recommendation function** that returns top N movie suggestions based on input.
- Explored user ratings data (if collaborative filtering included) to personalize recommendations.
- Visualized trends and distributions using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Text Vectorization**: TF-IDF  
- **Similarity Metrics**: Cosine Similarity  
- **IDE/Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code /Git Bash
